# Active_Directory_Lab

- In this repository I am going to show the layout of my Active Directory home lab, and talk about how I set things up (" This is not a step-by-step guide on how to set up the lab ").
- I will also discuss how I set up a splunk server in a controller enviorment and used it to monitor my AD computer on the network.
